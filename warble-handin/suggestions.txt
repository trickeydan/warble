It would be great if you could either give more guidance on using NodeJS with Azure Functions, or allow us to use the recommended C# .NET and the SDK it provides for functions.

Azure has been quite buggy in comparison to other platforms and this has hindered me significantly when working on this coursework. It would be good to see a different platform.

Further instruction on setting up the subscription would be useful too.
